## 🎯 Problem Statement & Solutions

### Current Challenges in Digital Storage

#### 1. Privacy Invasion
**Problem**: Traditional cloud storage providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud) have access to your unencrypted files and can scan, analyze, or share your content.
**Solution**: SecretGallery encrypts files on your device before upload, ensuring no third party can ever access your content.

#### 2. Centralization Risks
**Problem**: Single points of failure, potential censorship, and lack of user control over data.
**Solution**: Decentralized IPFS storage eliminates single points of failure and ensures your files remain accessible even if individual nodes go offline.

#### 3. Data Sovereignty Issues
**Problem**: Users don't have true ownership or control over their data stored on centralized platforms.
**Solution**: You maintain complete control over your encryption keys and access permissions through blockchain-based smart contracts.

#### 4. Insecure Sharing
**Problem**: Sharing files often involves sending decryption keys or plaintext data through insecure channels.
**Solution**: FHE-powered smart contracts enable secure sharing without ever revealing file contents or encryption keys.

#### 5. Lack of Transparency
**Problem**: Centralized services provide no verifiable proof of access controls or data handling practices.
**Solution**: All access permissions and operations are recorded on the blockchain, providing complete transparency and auditability.

#### 6. Vendor Lock-in
**Problem**: Difficulty migrating data between different storage providers.
**Solution**: Open standards and decentralized architecture ensure your data remains portable and accessible regardless of service provider.

### Detailed Workflow

#### 1. File Upload Process
```
User File → Local AES-256 Encryption → IPFS Upload → Hash Generation →
FHE Encryption → Smart Contract Storage → Access Control Setup
```

1. **Local Encryption**: File is encrypted using AES-256 with a randomly generated key
2. **Key Formatting**: Encryption key is formatted as an EVM address for compatibility
3. **IPFS Upload**: Encrypted file is uploaded to IPFS network
4. **Hash Processing**: IPFS hash is converted to numerical format for blockchain storage
5. **FHE Storage**: Both hash and encryption key are encrypted using FHE and stored in smart contract
6. **Access Control**: Owner permissions are automatically granted through ACL

#### 2. File Access Process
```
Access Request → Permission Verification → FHE Decryption → IPFS Retrieval →
Local File Decryption → Content Display
```

1. **Permission Check**: Smart contract verifies user's access rights
2. **FHE Decryption**: Authorized users can decrypt the file metadata
3. **IPFS Retrieval**: Encrypted file is downloaded from IPFS using the hash
4. **Local Decryption**: File is decrypted locally using the retrieved key
5. **Secure Display**: Content is displayed without storing plaintext data

#### 3. Sharing Mechanism
```
Share Request → Access Grant Transaction → FHE Permission Update →
Notification → Grantee Access Enabled
```

1. **Grant Initiation**: File owner initiates sharing with specific addresses
2. **Smart Contract Update**: FHE permissions are updated to include new users
3. **Blockchain Recording**: All sharing activities are recorded on blockchain
4. **Automatic Notification**: Grantees are notified of new access permissions

## 🔐 Security Model

### Threat Model & Mitigations

#### 1. Client-Side Security
- **Threat**: Malicious browser extensions or compromised client
- **Mitigation**: Isolated encryption context, secure key generation, and minimal key exposure time

#### 2. Network Security
- **Threat**: Man-in-the-middle attacks during upload/download
- **Mitigation**: End-to-end encryption ensures only encrypted data is transmitted

#### 3. Storage Security
- **Threat**: IPFS node compromise or data corruption
- **Mitigation**: Data redundancy across multiple nodes and cryptographic integrity verification

#### 4. Smart Contract Security
- **Threat**: Contract vulnerabilities or unauthorized access
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, formal verification, and time-locked critical operations

#### 5. Key Management Security
- **Threat**: Key loss or unauthorized key access
- **Mitigation**: User-controlled key management with optional backup mechanisms

### Cryptographic Guarantees

- **Confidentiality**: AES-256 encryption ensures only authorized users can access file contents
- **Integrity**: Cryptographic hashes verify file hasn't been tampered with
- **Authentication**: Digital signatures ensure actions are performed by authorized users
- **Non-repudiation**: Blockchain records provide immutable proof of all operations
